# Emotion-Detection-Using-CNN
A deep learning project for facial emotion detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Trained on datasets like FER2013 with real-time emotion recognition support.

This project performs facial emotion detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It can identify emotions like Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, etc., from real-time webcam input or images.
